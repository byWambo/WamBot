# You want to help me?
Feel free to commit or create a PR. If you got some questions, just add me on Discord: Wambo#0800

## Some stuff you might wanna know
* guild: get some neat information about your favourite guild!
* say: shy? let the bot speak for you.
* ping: you always wanted to know the ping of Wambot to the [discord servers](https://discordapp.com/)? Use this command!
* eval: evaluation made easy; you can execute python code with EZ *(this feature is powered by [PyEval](https://github.com/G3bE/PyEval))*
* It even has an auto role feature \o/ *(imagine a yay here)*, **BUT** *(ohhhh)* it's hardcoded at the moment... =(

**Wait? Is this the end already? Not possible! Whatever, new features will come soon.**
